# File-System-Explorer
A GUI-based File System Explorer built with Python (Tkinter). Features include creating, deleting, renaming files/folders, viewing details, and managing permissions. Also includes a Storage Allocation Simulator using the First-Fit strategy to demonstrate memory management.

It is designed as an **educational tool** for learning about file systems and memory allocation in Operating Systems.
