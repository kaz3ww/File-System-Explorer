# ​ File System Explorer

A GUI-based **File System Explorer** built with **Python (Tkinter)**.  
Explore, manage, and simulate file system behavior with:

- File/folder operations: Create, delete, rename, view details, modify permissions  
- Storage allocation simulation using the **First-Fit** strategy, visualized for clarity

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – core language  
- **Tkinter** – GUI framework  
- **Pillow** – Image support and icons  
- **(Optional)**: `virtualenv` for environment management
